  **warning** (E:\EE\project\spice\2.0\ms018.mdl:20) Model n18 device geometries will not be checked against the limits set by lmin, lmax, wmin and wmax. To enable this check, add a period(.) to the model name(i.e. enable model selector).

 **warning**  runlvl smaller than 5, reset to 5  when accurate turned on
  **warning** (e:\ee\project\spice\2.0\gm_complex.sp:3) Global net name, "gnd", in subckt pin list. The pin will be connected to the local net. Recommend to not use global net names in subckt pin lists.
  **error** (e:\ee\project\spice\2.0\gm_complex.sp:55) Number of nodes miss match between instance "x1              " and subcircuit "gm_c_3th_bandpass".  Subcircuit definition has   11 node(s) whereas subckt instance was found with   21 node(s). Please specify same number of nodes.
